For this lab, Haokun Liu and I implemented a method called print2Darray to print out the 2d array in a nice format by using 
printf and println. Then, we modified the method to make it work on a arraylist as well.
For task 2, we did a triple for loop to calculate the sum (and a switch statement, 1 2 3 4 for left right up down), and modified the method 
to make it work on the arraylist.
